# HCT Survival Prediction  

This repository focuses on predicting survival outcomes for patients undergoing **Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)** using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to enhance predictive accuracy.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  

- **notebooks/** â€“ Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- **data/** â€“ (If applicable) Raw and processed datasets used for training models.  

## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedembeddedxx/HCT-survival-prediction.git
   cd HCT-survival-prediction
   ```  
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and train models.  

## Objective  

The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that can estimate **survival probabilities** for HCT patients, aiding clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes.
